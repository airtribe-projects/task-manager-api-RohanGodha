# Task Manager API

Welcome to the **Task Manager API** built with Node.js and Express! This simple RESTful API allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks stored in memory. Each task includes details such as title, description, completion status, and priority.

## üöÄ Overview

This API provides basic CRUD operations and advanced filtering/sorting on tasks.

### Features
- Add a new task with title, description, completed status, and priority.
- Fetch all tasks or filter by completion or priority.
- Sort tasks by creation date.
- Update an existing task.
- Delete a task by ID.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is an in-memory implementation. Data is lost when the server restarts.
